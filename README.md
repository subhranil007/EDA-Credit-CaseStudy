# EDA Credit Case Study

## Problem Statemen

  - When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based 
on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business 
to the company.
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the 
loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
  - The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. 
the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its 
portfolio and risk assessment
